### Metric Extraction

The file 'metric_extraction_final.xlsx' contains all the information about our systematic extraction of metrics from the available literature. The sheet 'All' lists all the 2277 papers that the Scopus search system returned for our search string. 

The sheet 'MetricExtraction' lists all the 300 papers for which we proceeded with manual extraction of the metrics. The column 'Extracted By' indicates whether the metrics were extracted from abstract (denoted as '_From Abstract_') or from the full text by each of the authors (denoted as '_Author1'_, '_Author2_' or '_Author3_'). The column '_Metrics (Init)_' lists the metrics extracted from each paper at the initial stage. The column '_Metrics (Final)_' lists the final metrics extracted from the paper once the abbreviations and the definitions for the metrics have been discussed in a joint meeting between authors.

The sheet 'MetricStats' provides information about the statistics of the metrics. Column '_Count_' shows the number of papers that used each metric. Column '_Category_' indicates which category from Table 1 the metric belongs too. Column '_Category Count_' reports the count for each category.
